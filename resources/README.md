This folder consists of US census shapefile data, taken from [this URL](https://www.census.gov/geographies/mapping-files/time-series/geo/carto-boundary-file.html). The exploded ZIP archive was downloaded on 15 APRIL 2020 from [cb_2018_us_county_500k.zip](https://www2.census.gov/geo/tiger/GENZ2018/shp/cb_2018_us_county_500k.zip). The FIPS data processed from the SHP files is stored in the ``resources/fips_2018_data.pkl.gz`` 

I also want to find *recent* data that organizes counties (by FIPS code) into metropolitan areas. I was able to find the Excel spreadsheet of the [2019 metropolitan statistical areas](https://www2.census.gov/programs-surveys/popest/datasets/2010-2019/metro/totals/cbsa-est2019-alldata.csv). I have downloaded this Excel spreadsheet in ``resources/msa_2019.csv``, and the Excel spreadsheet version ``resources/msa_2019.xlsx``.
