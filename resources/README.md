This folder consists of US census shapefile data, taken from [this URL](https://www.census.gov/geographies/mapping-files/time-series/geo/carto-boundary-file.html). The exploded ZIP archive was downloaded on 17 APRIL 2020 from [cb_2018_us_county_500k.zip](https://www2.census.gov/geo/tiger/GENZ2018/shp/cb_2018_us_county_500k.zip).

I also want to find *recent* data that organizes counties (by FIPS code) into metropolitan areas. The only data I have found on the web is this [metro areas from 1999]().
