<p>This folder consists of US census shapefile data, taken from <a href="https://www.census.gov/geographies/mapping-files/time-series/geo/carto-boundary-file.html">this URL</a>. The exploded ZIP archive was downloaded on 15 APRIL 2020 from <a href="https://www2.census.gov/geo/tiger/GENZ2018/shp/cb_2018_us_county_500k.zip">cb_2018_us_county_500k.zip</a>. The FIPS data processed from the SHP files is stored in the <code>resources/fips_2018_data.pkl.gz</code></p>
<p>I also want to find <em>recent</em> data that organizes counties (by FIPS code) into metropolitan areas. I was able to find the Excel spreadsheet of the <a href="https://www2.census.gov/programs-surveys/popest/datasets/2010-2019/metro/totals/cbsa-est2019-alldata.csv">2019 metropolitan statistical areas</a>. I have downloaded this Excel spreadsheet in <code>resources/msa_2019.csv</code>, and the Excel spreadsheet version <code>resources/msa_2019.xlsx</code>.</p>
